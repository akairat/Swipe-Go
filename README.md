# Swipe'n'Go
Manage your events with just a swipe

MIT Specific App.
Events are filtered according to your preferences and if you're interested in a certain event, 
you can add it to your phone's calendar with a simple swipe to the right, otherwise you can 
skip it with a simple swipe to the left.
Swipe'n'Go is a tinder for events. :)
You can update your preferences using the menu on the top left of the screen.
You can also add new events to our events database running on Parse using the menu on the top left of the screen. 

Swipe'n'Go ;)!
